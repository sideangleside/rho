Command Syntax & Usage
======================

The basic syntax is:

``rho command subcommand [options]``

There are four rho commands:
 * ``auth`` - for managing auth entries
 * ``profile`` - for managing profile entries
 * ``scan`` - for running scans
 * ``fact`` - to show information about the facts rho can collect

``auth`` and ``profile`` both have five subcommands:
 * ``add`` - to create a new entry
 * ``edit`` - to modify an existing entry
 * ``clear`` - to remove any or all entries
 * ``show`` - to display a specific entry
 * ``list`` - to display one or more entries

``fact`` has two subcommands:
  * ``list`` - to display the list of facts that can be scanned
  * ``hash`` - to hash sensitive facts within report

The complete list of options for each command and subcommand are listed in the
rho manpage with other usage examples. The common options are listed with the
examples in this document.

Auth Entries
------------

The first step to configuring rho is adding auth credentials to use to connect
over SSH. Each authentication identity requires its own auth entry.

``rho auth add --name=server1creds --username=rho-user --sshkeyfile=/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key``

*Note:* --password not being passed or passed as empty are considered the same thing.

SSH Key with a Passphrase
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to handle ssh keys with passphrases. If a
passphrase-protected ssh key is specified in an auth and the key is
not present in the ssh agent, then Rho will prompt the user for the
passphrase each time it needs to use the key.

To avoid repetitive prompts, users can add their keys to the local ssh
agent (as documented at
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_getting_started.html),
which will decrypt them once and make them available to Rho.

Profiles
---------

Then, create the profile to use for the scan. This should include a list of IP
addresses or ranges, and the auth identity to use.

``rho profile add --name=profile1 --hosts 1.2.3.[0:255] --auth server1creds server2creds``

The hosts can be passed in as a file with all the ranges listed in newlines. Example below:

``rho profile edit --name=profile1 --hosts hosts_file --auth server1creds server2creds``

where ``hosts_file`` contains the ip address or ranges separated by newlines::

  1.2.3.1
  1.2.3.14
  1.2.4.34

Scanning
--------

The options required for a scan are the profile to use and the file path for
the report. Optionally we can pass the number of Ansible forks and the facts to
be collected. Finally the ``cache`` option tells rho that the profile you are
providing has already been processed for connection mappings.

``rho scan --profile=profile1 --reportfile=report.csv``

Since rho collects the successful host auth mappings from a full scan
the user doesn't have to worry about iterating through multiple auths and hosts
again and again in the same profile as long as the profile hasn't changed when
utilizing the ``cache`` option. For purposes of record keeping the host
mapping files are always written to whenever a scan is done using a profile.
When profiles are deleted the host auth mappings
corresponding to the profile are renamed with prefix *(DELETED PROFILE)* so that
they are recognizable. Every scan has a timestamp in the mappings.

As far as the auths used by the inventory of a particular scan is concerned, it
is important to note that the order of the auths passed into a profile matters.
A profile by definition takes in one ordering of auths and all the hosts in
the profile are tested in that order with the auths before the first auths to
work are picked to run the fact collection. Therefore, it's up to the user
to pass in auths as per the priority they deem fit for a profile. If a non root
auth is better tried first and then the root auth then the user has to pass in the
auths in the order as ``--auth <nonroot_1> <nonroot_2> <root_1> <root_2>`` etc.

The output of the Ansible process is saved to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rho/scan_log` by
default, for debugging. This location can be changed with the
`--logfile` flag.

Common Flags
------------

All rho commands accept the `-v` flag, which increases the verbosity
of rho's output. It comes in four varieties: `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, and
`-vvvv`, with more `v`'s indicating more verbose output. The verbose
output can be useful in debugging.

The output can then be configured to contain any combination of these fields by using the
``--facts`` option. The following is the format rho understands for all the facts. Some or all
of these facts can be requested by either as a CLI list i.e. ``--facts <fact_1> <fact_2>`` etc
or by passing in a file with a new fact on every line in the format as follows. A value
of 'default' will get all the information listed above.

For further details of the command usage view the following
`example <command_example.rst>`_.

Scan User Permissions
---------------------

Some of the output facts will report an error if the user used to perform the
scan does not have the appropriate permissions to execute the command used to
gather the targeted facts. The following set of facts require *admin/root*
permissions to collect the facts:

- ``cpu.socket_count``
- ``date.anaconda_log``
- ``date.yum_history``
- ``dmi.x``
- ``subman.x``
- ``virt.virt``
- ``virt.type``
- ``virt-what.x``

The scan user can successful collect these values if the user is **root** or
has the ability to perform a ``sudo``. The following
provides the necessary content for the ``/etc/sudoers`` file where *scanuser*
represents the username used for the scan.

::

  Cmnd_Alias SCAN = /sbin/subscription-manager, /usr/sbin/dmidecode, /usr/sbin/virt-what
  scanuser ALL=NOPASSWD: SCAN

If the scan user uses a password to sudo, one can be given with the
`--sudo-password` option to the `auth add` and `auth edit`
commands. The sudo-with-password fundtionality can be tested by using
the 'askpass' box in the Vagrantfile.

JBoss-EAP and -Scan Variants
----------------------------

The JBoss EAP facts are divided into two groups. Rho scans for the
following facts by default:

  - jboss.eap.running-versions

The following facts are available, but Rho will only scan for them if
requested using the `--facts` option:

  - jboss.eap.installed-versions
  - jboss.eap.deploy-dates

The `installed-versions` and `deploy-dates` facts are computed by
scanning the entire host filesystem with the `find` command. This can
take a large amount of system resources and could potentially have a
noticeable impact on the performance of running servers. The default
facts are a good way to get clues about which systems might have JBoss
installed before performing a resource-intensive scan, or even
removing the need for a scan entirely.

Programs on Remote Machines
---------------------------

Besides standard Unix utilities, some rho fact collectors depend on
specific programs being installed on the machines being scanned. The
complete list is at `remote programs
<github.com/quipucords/rho/doc/source/remote_programs.rst>`_.
